Hello! 

As instructed in the email here is this mini project. In order to run it, you will need to download the file as a ZIP. Then open it with your favourite code editor or with the cmd console and use the command npm run dev as it is a Vite project, created with React.

The page functioning is pretty straight forward. Just press the button to retrieve the data and the graphics and tables will show the output. Enjoy!
